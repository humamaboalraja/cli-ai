## âœ¨ Introduction
`Cli-AI` is a simple and easy to use tool that allows you to interact with OpenAI's GPT3 from your terminal.

 <br />


## Installation

##### NPM
```bash
npm install -g cli-ai
```
##### Yarn
```bash
yarn global add cli-ai
```

<br />


## Setup

#### Linux/MacOS

To use `cli-ai` you need to have an OpenAI API key. You can get one [here](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys). This is how you can set it up in `zsh`, `bash` shells

**zsh**
To Setup the keu replace `YOUR_KEY_GOES_HERE` with your OpenAI API key which you can get from [here](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) and run this command in your terminal
```bash
echo "export OPENAI_API_KEY='YOUR_KEY_GOES_HERE'" >> ~/.zshrc
```

Update the state of your shell with the newly added variable:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```
Verify that the environment variable has been set correctly:
```bash
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY
```

**Bash**
Same as zsh but replace `~/.zshrc` with `~/.bashrc`
```bash
# Set your API key
echo "export OPENAI_API_KEY='YOUR_KEY_GOES_HERE'" >> ~/.bashrc
# Update the state of your shell with the newly added variable
source ~/.bashrc
# Confirm that you have set your environment variable
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY
```

<br/>

## Usage
